# HomeServer

## Usage

````
 Execute-ServerProcess.ps1 -Action [START|STOP] -ProcessName [DONTSTARVE|OPENTTD]
````

The Don't Starve Overworld and Caves shards are launched using launch_preconfigured_servers.bat. These shards should be setup prior to running this script because the Klei authentication tokens are needed.

OpenTTD is currently using the default settings when starting a server.
